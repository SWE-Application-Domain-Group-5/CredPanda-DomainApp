Summary:
We are going to use Microsoft Visual Studio to create a ASP.NET CORE (MVC), we will be making a finance management program. One group will create the front-end and one group will create the back-end (and connect the database). We will store users and users’ data in the database, with passwords and private information being encrypted. Administrators will not have access to user’s personal information but administrators can activate and deactivate users. Users can reset their passwords with a forgot password button.
